Sadbhava India is an initiative by like minded people to help and aid the migrant labourers, daily wage workers and the underprivileged to help combat the consequences of the pandemic, with special focus on Bihar for the present.

The primary goal is to build an effective support system beginning with identification of the caregivers and connect them to the people in need. It will be accomplished through the process of resource mapping, predominantly for essentials such as infrastructure, food, and medical facilities and general awareness about disease and personal hygiene.

Our other objective is to spread awareness about COVID-19 and provide timely information to ensure that that the people, specially the ones who are most affected, are well informed and taken care of. 
Along with this initiative, we also intend to take measures to help ensure the long-term sustainability of the labourers, daily wage workers and other underprivileged members of the society.
